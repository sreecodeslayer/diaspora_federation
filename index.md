# diaspora\* federation protocol

The purpose of this document is to specify the communications that go on between diaspora\* servers (and other servers
supporting this protocol). If you experience any issues, feel free to [get in touch][communication] with us.

## Federation support

This document specifies the future protocol for diaspora. diaspora\* release 0.6.0.0 and newer has support to receive
entities with this protocol, but still sends entities with an older protocol. Starting with diaspora\* release X this
protocol is fully supported.
